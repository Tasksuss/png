This is the repositories for the Programming 2 Coursework at the Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College
The goal of this project is to create a PNG file opener and editor that can separate the RGB colour fields using
OOP knowledge we have learned during the module. The idea is that with this program, we could separate the image
of Brainbows into separate channels so that specific neuronal information could be analysed accordingly.
The body of the programme is written in Python, supported by 3.11.4 IDLE.
